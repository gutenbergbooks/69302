Stevenson calls “The Land of Play,” it has been a pleasure to select
from the verse and prose of our best writers, old and new, the contents
of this pictured volume for “The Little People,” and perchance for some
older traveller who may wish to be,—

    “A sailor on the rain-pool sea,
    A climber in the clover tree;
    And just come back a sleepy-head,
    Late at night to go to bed.”

    Hie away, hie away!
    Over bank and over brae,
    Where the copsewood is the greenest,
    Where the fountains glisten sheenest,

    Where the morning dew lies longest,
    Over bank and over brae,

CHARLIE’S STORY.


    I was sitting in the twilight,
        With my Charlie on my knee,—
    Little two-year-old, forever
        Teasing, “Talk a ’tory p’ease to me.”
    “Now,” I said, “talk _me_ a ’tory.”
        “Well,” all smiles,—“now, I will ’mence.
    Mamma, I did see a kitty,—
        Great—big—kitty,—on the fence.”

    Mamma smiles. Five little fingers
        Cover up her laughing lips.
    “Is ’oo laughing?” “Yes,” I tell him,
        But I kiss the finger-tips;
    And I beg him tell another.
        “Well,” reflectively, “I’ll ’mence.
    Mamma, I did see a doggie,—
        Great—big—doggie,—on the fence.”

    “Rather similar,—your stories,—
        Aren’t they, dear?” A sober look
    Swept across the pretty forehead;
        Then he sudden courage took.
    “But I know a nice, new ’tory,—
        ’Plendid mamma! Hear me ’mence.
    Mamma, I did see a elfunt,—
        Great—big—elfunt,—on a fence.”

    Old King Cole
    Was a merry old soul,
    And a merry old soul was he;

[Illustration]

    He called for his pipe,
    And he called for his bowl,
    And he called for his fiddlers three.

    Every fiddler, he had a fiddle,
    And a very fine fiddle had he;
    Twee tweedle dee, tweedle dee, went the fiddlers.

        Oh, there’s none so rare,
        As can compare
    With King Cole and his fiddlers three!

    And who do you think they be?
      The butcher, the baker,
      The candlestick-maker;
    Turn ’em out, knaves all three!




_There Was a Little Man._


    There was a little man, and he had a little gun,
      And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;
    He went to the brook, and saw a little duck,
      And shot it through the head, head, head.

    He carried it home to his old wife Joan,
      And bade her a fire to make, make, make,
    To roast the little duck he had shot in the brook,
      And he’d go and fetch the drake, drake, drake.




_Fiddle-de-dee._


    Fiddle-de-dee, fiddle-de-dee,
    The fly shall marry the humble-bee,
    They went to the church, and married was she,
    The fly has married the humble-bee.




SEVEN TIMES ONE.


[Illustration]

    There’s no dew left on the daisies and clover,
        There’s no rain left in heaven;
    I’ve said my “seven times” over and over—
        Seven times one are seven.

    I am old! so old I can write a letter;
        My birthday lessons are done;
    The lambs play always, they know no better;
        They are only one time one.

    Oh, moon! in the night I have seen you sailing,
        And shining so round and low;
    You were bright! Ah, bright! but your light is failing;
        You are nothing now but a bow.

    You Moon! have you done something wrong in heaven,
        That God has hidden your face?
    I hope if you have, you will soon be forgiven,
        And shine again in your place.

    O, velvet Bee! you’re a dusty fellow,
        You’ve powdered your legs with gold;
    O, brave marsh Mary-buds, rich and yellow!
        Give me your money to hold.

    O, Columbine! open your folded wrapper
        Where two twin turtle-doves dwell;
    O, Cuckoo-pint! toll me the purple clapper,
        That hangs in your clear green bell.

    And show me your nest with the young ones in it—
        I will not steal them away;
    I am old! you must trust me, Linnet, Linnet—
        I am seven times one to-day.

GOING INTO BREECHES.


    Joy to Philip! he this day
    Has his long coats cast away,
    And (the childish season gone)
    Put the manly breeches on.

    Sashes, frocks, to those that need ’em,
    Philip’s limbs have got their freedom—
    He can run, or he can ride,
    And do twenty things beside.
    Which his petticoats forbade;
    Is he not a happy lad?

    Baste-the-bear he now may play at;
    Leap-frog, foot-ball sport away at;
    Show his skill and strength at cricket,
    Mark his distance, pitch his wicket;
    Run about in winter’s snow
    Till his cheeks and fingers glow;
    Climb a tree or scale a wall,
    Without any fear to fall.
    This and more must now be done,
    Now the breeches are put on.

MR. PEGGOTTY’S HOUSE.


I had known Mr. Peggotty’s quaint house very well in my childhood, and
I am sure I could not have been more charmed with it if it had been
Aladdin’s palace, roc’s egg and all. It was an old black barge or boat,
high and dry on Yarmouth sands, with an iron funnel sticking out of it
for a chimney. There was a delightful door cut in the side, and it was
roofed in, and there were little windows in it. It was beautifully clean,
and as tidy as possible. There were some lockers and boxes, and there was
a table, and there was a Dutch clock, and there was a chest of drawers,
and there was a tea-tray with a painting on it, and the tray was kept
from tumbling down by a Bible, and the tray if it _had_ tumbled down,
would have Smashed a quantity of cups and saucers and a tea-pot that were
grouped around the book.

On the walls were colored pictures of Abraham in red going to sacrifice
Isaac in blue, and of Daniel in yellow being cast into a den of roaring
green lions. Over the little mantleshelf was a picture of the “Sarah
Jane” lugger, built at Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck
on it—a work of Art combining composition with carpentry, which I had
regarded in my childhood as one of the most enviable possessions the
world could afford.

    Buff neither laughs nor smiles,

    With a very good grace,
    And passes the stick to the very next place!

APRIL.


[Illustration]

    The wild and windy March once more
        Has closed his gates of sleep,
    And given us back our April time,
        So fickle and so sweet.

    Now blighting with our fears—our hopes,
        Now kindling hopes with fears—
    Now softly weeping through the smiles,
        Now smiling through the tears.

                                                            —_Alice Cary._




THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR.


    I.

    Said the Table to the Chair,
    “You can hardly be aware,
    How I suffer from the heat,
    And from chilblains on my feet.
    If we took a little walk,
    We might have a little talk;
    Pray let us take the air,”
    Said the Table to the Chair.

    II.

    Said the Chair unto the Table,
    “Now you _know_ we are not able:
    How foolishly you talk,
    When you know we _cannot_ walk!”
    Said the Table with a sigh,
    “It can do no harm to try.
    I’ve as many legs as you:
    Why can’t we walk on two?”

    III.

    So they both went slowly down,
    And walked about the town,
    With a cheerful bumpy sound,
    As they toddled round and round;
    And everybody cried,
    As they hastened to their side,
    “See! the Table and the Chair!”

    IV.

    But in going down an alley,
    To a castle in a valley,
    They completely lost their way,
    And wandered all the day;
    Till, to see them safely back,
    They paid a Ducky-quack,
    And a Beetle, and a Mouse,
    Who took them to their house.

    V.

    Then they whispered to each other,
    “O, delightful little brother,
    What a lovely walk we’ve taken!
    Let us dine on beans and bacon.”
    So the Ducky and the leetle
    Browny-Mousy and the Beetle
    Dined, and danced upon their heads
    Till they toddled to their beds.

THE BRAVE BROTHER.


    I was scared almost to death
    When I heard my sister Beth
        Screeching loud and crying.
    But I ran and took a stick,
    And I tell you, pretty quick,
    I had taught our goose a trick,
        And had sent him flying.

    Girls are always frightened stiff,
    Just as sister Beth was, if
        That cross, ugly gander
    Flies across the garden fence.
    And they always will commence
    Screaming,—’stead of having sense
        And showing out some dander.

    I made believe, with all my might,
    He was a dragon, dressed in white,
        With his fiery red mouth grinning,—
    Like that one mother read about,
    That old St. George marched forth and fought,
    And beat and killed him out and out
        Almost in the beginning.

    And once I heard my father say,
    “It’s pretty sure to be the way,
        When you’re awful frightened,
    If you fight till you’re ’most dead,
    Bravely, you’ll come out ahead;”
    But sister told me mother said,
        “You might,—and then you mightn’t!”

    But pass my imperfections by.
    Large streams from little fountains flow,
    Tall oaks from little acorns grow.

    The lily has an air,
        And the snowdrop a grace,

    When it blows.

A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES


    Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose.
        The spectacles set them unhappily wrong;
    The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,
        To which the sad spectacles ought to belong.

    So Tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause
        With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning;
    While Chief-Baron Ear sat to balance the laws,
        So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.

    “In behalf of the Nose it will quickly appear,
        And your lordship,” he said, “will undoubtedly find
    That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,
        Which amounts to possession time out of mind.”

    Then holding the spectacles up to the Court—
        “Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle,
    As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,
        Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.

    “Again, would your lordship a moment suppose
        (’Tis a case that has happened, and may be again),
    That the visage or countenance had not a nose,
        Pray who would, or who could, wear spectacles then?

    “On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,
        With a reasoning the Court will never condemn,
    That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,
        And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.”

    Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),
        He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes;
    But what were his arguments few people know,
        For the Court did not think they were equally wise.

    So his lordship decreed with a brave solemn tone,
        Decisive and clear, without one if or but—
    “That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,
        By daylight or candlelight—Eyes should be shut!”

To err is human, to forgive divine.

    The man that hails you Tom or Jack,
    And proves by thumping on your back,
        His sense of your great merit,
    Is such a friend that one had need
    Be very much his friend, indeed,
        To pardon or to bear it.

_The Old Woman and Her Pig._


[Illustration]

An old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked
sixpence. “What,” said she, “shall I do with this little sixpence? I will
go to market, and buy a little pig.” As she was coming home, she came to
a stile; the piggy would not go over the stile.

She went a little farther, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog—

    “Dog, dog, bite pig;
    Piggy won’t get over the stile;
    And I shan’t get home to-night.”

But the dog would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a stick. So she said—

[Illustration]

    “Stick, stick, beat dog;
    Dog won’t bite pig;
    Piggy won’t get over the stile;
    And I shan’t get home to-night.”

But the stick would not. She went a little farther, and she met a fire.
So she said—

    “Fire, fire, burn stick;
    Stick won’t beat dog;
    Dog won’t bite pig;
    Piggy won’t get over the stile;
    And I shan’t get home to-night.”

But the fire would not.

[Illustration]

She went a little farther, and she met some water. So she said—

    “Water, water, quench fire;
    Fire won’t burn stick;” etc.

But the water would not.

[Illustration]

She went a little farther, and she met an ox. So she said—

    “Ox, ox, drink water;
    Water won’t quench fire;” etc.

But the ox would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a butcher. So she said—

    “Butcher, butcher, kill ox;
    Ox won’t drink water;” etc.

But the butcher would not. She went a little farther, and she met a rope.
So she said—

    “Rope, rope, hang butcher;
    Butcher won’t kill ox;” etc.

But the rope would not. She went a little farther, and she met a rat. So
she said—

    “Rat, rat, gnaw rope;
    Rope won’t hang butcher;” etc.

But the rat would not.

[Illustration]

She went a little farther, and she met a cat. So she said—

    “Cat, cat, kill rat;
    Rat won’t gnaw rope;” etc.

But the cat said to her, “If you will go to yonder cow, and fetch me a
saucer of milk, I will kill the rat.” So away went the old woman to the
cow, and said—

    “Cow, cow, give me a saucer of milk;
    Cat won’t kill rat;” etc.

But the cow said to her, “If you will go to yonder haymakers, and fetch
me a wisp of hay, I’ll give you the milk.” So away went the old woman to
the haymakers, and said—

    “Haymakers, give me a wisp of hay;
    Cow won’t give me milk;” etc.

[Illustration]

But the haymakers said to her, “If you will go to yonder stream, and
fetch us a bucket of water, we’ll give you the hay.” So away the old
woman went; but when she got to the stream, she found the bucket was full
of holes. So she covered the bottom with pebbles, and then filled the
bucket with water, and away she went back with it to the haymakers; and
they gave her a wisp of hay. As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she
gave the old woman the milk; and away she went with it in a saucer to the
cat. As soon as the cat had lapped up the milk—

    The cat began to kill the rat;
    The rat began to gnaw the rope;
    The rope began to hang the butcher;
    The butcher began to kill the ox;
    The ox began to drink the water;
    The water began to quench the fire;
    The fire began to burn the stick;
    The stick began to beat the dog;
    The dog began to bite the pig;
    The little pig in a fright jumped over the stile;
    And so the old woman got home that night.

    “A-spinning a doublet for my gude man.”

    “Oh, no, Mr. Puss, you will bite off my head.”




THE BROWN THRUSH.


[Illustration]

    There’s a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree.
    He’s singing to me! He’s singing to me!
    And what does he say, little girl, little boy?
    “Oh, the world’s running over with joy!
              Don’t you hear? Don’t you see?
              Hush! Look! In my tree
              I’m as happy as happy can be!”

    And the brown thrush keeps singing, “A nest do you see
    And five eggs, hid by me in the juniper?
    Don’t meddle! Don’t touch! little girl, little boy,
    Or the world will lose some of its joy!
              Now I’m glad! Now I’m free!
              And I always shall be,
              If you never bring sorrow to me.”

    So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,
    To you and to me, to you and to me;
    And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,
    “O, the world’s running over with joy!”
              But long it won’t be,
              Don’t you know? Don’t you see?
              Unless we’re as good as can be.

A LOBSTER QUADRILLE.


    “Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail,
    “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.”
    See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
    They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
    Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
    Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

    “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
    When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
    But the snail replied, “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
    Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.

    “What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied,
    “There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.”
    The further off from England, the nearer is to France—
    Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
    Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
    Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

THE BAREFOOT BOY.


[Illustration]

    Blessings on thee, little man,
    Barefoot boy with cheek of tan!
    With thy turned-up pantaloons,
    And thy merry whistled tunes;
    With thy red lips, redder still
    Kissed by strawberries on the hill;
    With the sunshine on thy face,
    Through thy torn brims jaunty grace:
    From my heart I give thee joy—
    I was once a barefoot boy!
    Prince thou art—the grown-up man
    Only is republican.
    Let the million-dollared ride!
    Barefoot, trudging at his side,
    Thou hast more than he can buy
    In the reach of ear and eye—
    Outward sunshine, inward joy:
    Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!

    O, for boyhood’s painless play,
    Sleep that wakes in laughing day,
    Health that mocks the doctor’s rules,
    Knowledge never learned of schools,
    Of the wild bees’ morning chase,
    Of the wild-flower’s time and place,
    Flight of fowl and habitude
    Of the tenants of the wood;
    How the tortoise bears his shell,
    How the woodchuck digs his cell
    And the ground-mole sinks his well;
    How the robin feeds her young,
    How the oriole’s nest is hung;
    Where the whitest lilies blow,
    Where the freshest berries grow,
    Where the groundnut trails its vine,
    Where the wood-grapes’ clusters shine;
    Of the black wasp’s cunning way,
    Mason of his walls of clay,
    And the architectural plans
    Of gray hornet artisans!
    For eschewing books and tasks,
    Nature answers all he asks;
    Hand in hand with her he walks,
    Face to face with her he talks,
    Part and parcel of her joy—
    Blessings on the barefoot boy.

    O, for boyhood’s time of June,
    Crowding years in one brief moon,
    When all things I heard or saw,
    Me, their master, waited, for
    I was rich in flowers and trees,
    Humming birds and honey-bees;
    For my sport the squirrel played,
    Plied the snouted mole his spade;
    For my taste the blackberry cone
    Purpled over hedge and stone;
    Laughed the brook for my delight,
    Through the day and through the night,
    Whispering at the garden wall,
    Talked with me from fall to fall;
    Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,
    Mine the walnut slopes beyond,
    Mine, on bending orchard trees,
    Apples of Hesperides!
    Still as my horizon grew,
    Larger grew my riches, too;
    All the world I saw and knew
    Seemed a complex Chinese toy,
    Fashioned for a barefoot boy!

    O, for festal dainties spread,
    Like my bowl of milk and bread—
    Pewter spoon and bowl of wood,
    On the door-stone, gray and rude—
    O’er me like a regal tent,
    Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent,
    Purple-curtained, fringed with gold,
    Looped in many a wind-swung fold;
    While for music came the play
    Of the pied frogs’ orchestra;
    And, to light the noisy choir,
    Lit the fly his lamps of fire.
    I was monarch; pomp and joy
    Waited on the barefoot boy!

    Cheerily, then, my little man,
    Live and laugh, as boyhood can!
    Though the flinty slopes be hard,
    Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,
    Every morn shall lead thee through
    Fresh baptisms of the dew;
    Every evening from thy feet
    Shall the cool wind kiss the heat:
    All too soon these feet must hide
    In the prison cells of pride,
    Lose the freedom of the sod,
    Like a colt’s for work be shod,
    Made to tread the mills of toil,
    Up and down in ceaseless moil:
    Happy if their track be found
    Never on forbidden ground;
    Happy if they sink not in
    Quick and treacherous sands of sin:
    Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy,
    Ere it passes, barefoot boy!

A STORY OF WASHINGTON.


[Illustration]

During the Revolutionary War, the corporal of a little band of soldiers
was giving orders about a heavy beam which they were trying to raise to
the top of the wall. It was almost too heavy for them, and the voice of
the corporal was often heard shouting, “Heave away! There it goes! Heave
ho!”

A man in citizen’s clothes was passing, and asked the corporal why he did
not help them. Very much astonished, the corporal replied, with the pomp
of an emperor, “Sir, I am a corporal!”

“You are, are you?” replied the stranger; “I was not aware of that,” and
taking off his hat he bowed, saying, “I ask your pardon, Mr. Corporal.”

Upon this he put his shoulder to the beam and pulled until the sweat
stood on his forehead. When the beam was right, he turned to the
corporal, saying, “Mr. Corporal, when you have another such job and have
not men enough, send for your commander-in-chief, and I shall gladly come
to help you a second time.”

The corporal was thunderstruck. It was Washington.

    There was a fat man of Bombay,

      The birds began to sing;
    Was not that a dainty dish
      To set before the king?

    The king was in the parlour
      Counting, out his money;
    The queen was in the kitchen,
      Eating bread and honey;

    The maid was in the garden,
      Hanging out the clothes;
    There came a little blackbird,
      And snipped off her nose.

EPITAPH ON A FREE BUT TAME REDBREAST.


    These are not dewdrops, these are tears,
      And tears by Sally shed,
    For absent Robin, who she fears,
      With too much cause, is dead.

    One morn he came not to her hand
      As he was wont to come,
    And, on her finger perch’d, to stand
      Picking his breakfast crumb.

    Alarm’d, she called him, and perplex’d,
      She sought him, but in vain;
    That day he came not, nor the next,
      Nor ever came again.

    She therefore raised him here a tomb,
      Though where he fell, or how,
    None knows, so secret was his doom,
      Nor where he moulders now.

    Had half a score of coxcombs died
      In social Robin’s stead,
    Poor Sally’s tears had soon been dried
      Or haply never shed.

    But Bob was neither rudely bold
      Nor spiritlessly tame;
    Nor was, like theirs, his bosom cold,
      But always in a flame.

MY BLUE-EYED BABY BOY.


        You ask me why I’m smiling so,
        When every stock and bond is low;
    Why my heart seems full, and running o’er with joy.
        Can’t you guess the reason, say?
        I am sure ’tis plain as day—
    I’ve been romping with my blue-eyed baby boy.

        Though I faint beneath my cares,
        And my wheat seems full of tares,
    I can still have fullest peace without alloy;
        For in the twilight gloam,
        I shall hasten to my home,
    And be greeted by my blue-eyed baby boy.

        Let the morbid fellow groan,
        In a melancholy tone,
    Seeing only thorns and thistles that annoy;
        Missing all the roses nigh,
        And not once suspecting why—
    He has never had a blue-eyed baby boy.

PLAYING TABLEAUX.


    Mother dressed us up for tableaux,
      Little Cousin Lu and me;
    And I heard the people saying,
      We were cute as we could be!
    Maybe Lu looked rather pretty,
      But a boy dressed up like that,
    With a great long coat around him,
      And his Father’s new silk hat,

    Feels like running off and hiding;
      And I would have done it, too,
    If I hadn’t promised Mother,
      I would be as good as Lu.
    Lu was dressed in shining satin,
      With a veil fixed on her head,
    Just like Aunt Lucille last summer,
      When she married Uncle Ned.

    But I mean to marry Mother,
      When I’ve grown up big and strong;
    I was six years old last Sunday,
      So it won’t take very long.
    When I told her all about it,
      She just laughed and shook her head,
    “When you’re quite grown up, my laddie,
      You’ll ask someone else instead.”

    But when she came back,

      To buy him some linen;
    But when she came back,
      The dog was spinning.

    She went to the hosier’s
      To buy him some hose;
    But when she came back,
      He was dressed in his clothes.

    The dame made a curtsey,
      The dog made a bow;
    The dame said, “Your servant,”

      Was Dame Hubbard’s delight;
    He could sing, he could dance,
      He could read, he could write.

    She gave him rich dainties
      Whenever he fed,
    And erected a monument
      When he was dead.

SPRING SONG.


    Spring comes hither,
        Buds the rose;
    Roses wither,
        Sweet Spring goes.

            Summer soars,—
                Wide-winged day;
            White light pours,
                Flies away.

                    Soft winds blow,
                        Westward born;

                        Toward the morn.

PLAYING MOTHER—A MONOLOGUE.


[Illustration]

    Now, dollie, dear, you have been here
    For a long time, almost a year,
    And we have played with one another—
    That you were baby, I was mother.
    Now let us change about, I pray,
    And you be mother for to-day.

    Now you must go to town, you say!
    Then tell me, ’fore you go away,
    A lot of things I must not do,
    And point your finger at me, too,
    This way: Now don’t climb up on chairs,
    And don’t go tumblin’ down the stairs;
    Don’t tease your little sister, dear,
    And don’t do anything that’s queer.

    Don’t say “I won’t” to Auntie Bee—
    What is it you are telling me?
    You won’t say “Don’t” to me to-day?
    Well, then, how can I disobey?
    I wish my truly mother could
    Make it so easy to be good!

    He followed her to school one day;
      That was against the rule;
    It made the children laugh and play
      To see a lamb at school.

    And so the teacher turned him out,
      But still he lingered near,
    And waited patiently about
      Till Mary did appear.

    Then he ran to her, and laid
      His head upon her arm,
    As if he said, “I’m not afraid—
      You’ll keep me from all harm.”

    “What makes the lamb love Mary so?”
      The eager children cry.
    “Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know,”

A MODEST WIT.


    A supercilious nabob of the East—
      Haughty, being great—purse-proud, being rich—
    A governor, or general, at the least,
      I have forgotten which—
    Had in his family a humble youth,
      Who went from England in his patron’s suit,
    An unassuming boy, in truth
      A lad of decent parts, and good repute.

        This youth had sense and spirit;
          But yet with all his sense,
          Excessive diffidence
        Obscured his merit.

    One day, at table, flushed with pride and wine,
      His Honor, proudly free, severely merry,
    Conceived it would be vastly fine
      To crack a joke upon his secretary.

    “Young man,” he said, “by what art, craft, or trade,
      Did your good father gain a livelihood?”—
    “He was a saddler, sir,” Modestus said,
      “And in his time was reckon’d good.”

    “A saddler, eh! and taught you Greek,
      Instead of teaching you to sew!
    Pray why did not your father make
      A saddler, sir, of you?”

    Each parasite, then, as in duty bound,
    The joke applauded, and the laugh went round.
    At length Modestus, bowing low,
      Said (craving pardon, if too free he made),
    “Sir, by your leave, I fain would know
      _Your_ father’s trade!”

    “My father’s _trade_! by heaven that’s too bad!
    My father’s trade? Why, blockhead, are you mad?
    My father, sir, did never stoop so low—
    He was a gentleman, I’d have you know.”

    “Excuse the liberty I take,”
      Modestus said, with archness on his brow,
    “Pray, why did not your father make
      A gentleman of you?”

    “There goes the curly-headed boy—
        The boy that never tells a lie.”

    And everybody loved him so,
        Because he always told the truth,
    That every day, as he grew up,
        ’Twas said, “There goes the honest youth.”

“Oh, father,” said a little frog to a big frog, sitting by the side of a
pool, “I have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a mountain,
with horns on its head. It had a long tail, and hoofs divided in two.”

“Tush, child, tush,” said the old frog, “that was only Farmer White’s ox.
I can easily make myself as big; just you see.” And he blew himself out.
“Was he as big as that?” he asked.

“Oh, much bigger than that,” said the young frog.

Again the old frog blew himself out, and asked the young one if the ox
was as big.

“Bigger, father,” was the reply, “much bigger.”

Then the old frog took a very deep breath, and blew and swelled, and
swelled and blew—until he burst!

A CHILD’S LAUGHTER.


[Illustration]

    All the bells of heaven may ring,
    All the birds of heaven may sing,
    All the wells on earth may spring,
    All the winds on earth may bring
        All sweet sounds together;
    Sweeter far than all things heard,
    Hand of harper, tone of bird,
    Sound of woods at sundown stirred,
    Welling water’s winsome word,
        Wind in warm, wan weather.

    One thing yet there is that none
    Hearing, ere its chime be done,
    Knows not well the sweetest one
    Heard of man beneath the sun,
        Hoped in heaven hereafter;
    Soft and strong and loud and light,
    Very sound of very light,
    Heard from morning’s rosiest height,
    When the soul of all delight
        Fills a child’s clear laughter.

    Golden bells of welcome rolled
    Never forth such note, nor told
    Hours so blithe in tones so bold,
    As the radiant month of gold
        Here that rings forth heaven.
    If the golden-crested wren
    Were a nightingale—why, then

    Might be half as sweet as when

    Do not serve me so, I pray!
    Don’t you see the wool that grows
    On my back to make you clothes?
    Cold, ah, very cold you’d be,
    If you had not wool from me.

    “True, it seems a pleasant thing
    Nipping daisies in the spring;
    But what chilly nights I pass
    On the cold and dewy grass,
    Or pick my scanty dinner where
    All the ground is brown and bare!

    When the merry spring is past;
    Cuts my wooly fleece away,
    For your coat in wintry day.
    Little master, this is why
    In the pleasant fields I lie.”

    With sweet musk roses and with eglantine.

A BLADE OF GRASS.


Gather a single blade of grass, and examine for a minute its narrow
sword-shaped strip of fluted green. Nothing, as it seems, is there of
notable goodness or beauty. A very little strength, and a very little
tallness, and a few delicate long lines meeting in a point—not a perfect
point, either, but blunt and unfinished—by no means a creditable or
apparently much-cared-for example of Nature’s workmanship, made only
to be trodden on to-day, and to-morrow to be cast into the oven; and a
little pale hollow stalk, feeble and flaccid, leading down to the dull
brown fibers of roots.

And yet think of it well, and judge whether of all the gorgeous flowers
that beam in summer air, and of all the strong and goodly trees, pleasant
to the eyes or good for food—stately palm and pine, strong ash and oak,
scented citron, burdened vine—there be any by man so deeply loved, by God
so highly graced, as that narrow point of feeble green.

GOOD-NIGHT AND GOOD-MORNING.


[Illustration]

    A fair little girl sat under the tree
    Sewing as long as her eyes could see;
    Then smoothed her work and folded it right,
    And said, “Dear work, good-night, good-night!”

    Such a number of rooks came over her head
    Crying, “Caw, caw!” on their way to bed;
    She said as she watched their curious flight,
    “Little black things, good-night, good-night!”

    The horses neighed, and the oxen lowed;
    The sheep’s “Bleat, bleat!” came over the road,
    All seeming to say with a quiet delight,
    “Good little girl, good-night, good-night!”

    She did not say to the sun, “Good-night!”
    Though she saw him there like a ball of light;
    For she knew he had God’s own time to keep
    All over the world, and never could sleep.

    The tall, pink Fox-glove bowed his head—
    The violets curtesied, and went to bed;
    And good little Lucy tied up her hair
    And said, on her knees, her favorite prayer.

    And while on her pillow she softly lay,
    She knew nothing more till again it was day,
    And all things said to the beautiful sun,
    “Good-morning, good-morning! our work is begun.”

    Peter, Peter, pumpkin-eater,
    Had another and didn’t love her;
    Peter learned to read and spell,
    And then he loved her very well.

_My Lady Wind, my Lady Wind._


    My Lady Wind, my Lady Wind,
    Went round about the house to find
      A chink to get her foot in.
    She tried the key-hole in the door,
    She tried the crevice in the floor,
      And drove the chimney soot in.

    And then one night when it was dark
    She blew up such a tiny spark,
      That all the house was bothered:
    From it she raised up such a flame,
    As flamed away to Belting Lane,
      And White Cross folks were smothered.

    And thus when once, my little dears,
    A whisper reaches itching ears,
      The same will come, you’ll find:
    Take my advice, restrain the tongue,
    Remember what old Nurse has sung
      Of busy Lady Wind!

    Brought back those tarts,

HIAWATHA’S CHILDHOOD.

From “The Song of Hiawatha.”


    At the door on summer evenings
    Sat the little Hiawatha;
    Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,
    Heard the lapping of the water,
    Sounds of music, words of wonder;
        “Minne-wawa!” said the pine trees,
        “Mudway-aushka!” said the water.
    Saw the firefly, Wah-wah-taysee,
    Flitting through the dusk of evening
    With the twinkle of his candle
    Lighting up the brakes and bushes,
    And he sang the song of children,
    Sang the song Nokomis taught him:
    “Wah-wah-taysee, little firefly.
    Little, flitting, white-fire insect,
    Little, dancing, white-fire creature,
    Light me with your little candle,
    Ere upon my bed I lay me,
    Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!”
    Forth into the forest straightway
    All alone walked Hiawatha
    Proudly, with his bow and arrows;
    And the birds sang round him, o’er him,
        “Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!”
        Sang the robin, the Opechee,
        Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
        “Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!”
    Up the oak-tree, close beside him,
    Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
    In and out among the branches,
    Coughed, and chattered from the oak-tree,
    Laughed, and said between his laughing,
        “Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!”
    But he heeded not, nor heard them,
    For his thoughts were with the red deer;
    On their tracks his eyes were fastened,
    Leading downward to the river,
    To the ford across the river,
    And as one in slumber walked he.

    Let rocks their silence break—

THE NATIONAL FLAG.


There is the national flag! He must be cold, indeed, who can look upon
its folds rippling in the breeze without pride of country. If he be in a
foreign land the flag is companionship and country itself, with all its
endearments. It has been called “a floating piece of poetry,” and yet I
know not if it have greater beauty than other ensigns. Its highest beauty
is in what it symbolizes. It is because it represents all, that all gaze
at it with delight and reverence. It is a piece of bunting lifted in the
air, but it speaks sublimely, and every part has a voice. Its stripes of
alternate red and white proclaim the original union of thirteen states
to maintain the Declaration of Independence. Its stars of white in a
field of blue proclaim that union of States constituting our national
constellation, which receives a new star with every state. The two
together signify union, past and present. The very colors have a language
which was officially recognized by our fathers. White is for purity, red
for valor, blue for justice; and all together, bunting, stars, stripes,
and colors, blazing in the sky, make the flag of our country—to be
cherished by all our hearts, to be upheld by all our hands.

BLIND MAN’S BUFF.

    Caught them, ’till his cousin May
    Saw him peek, and cried, “No fair,
    Charlie boy, how do you dare.”

    Charlie hung his head in shame,
    Ran and left them to their game,
    Hid himself behind the door
    For at least an hour or more.

THE FIELD MOUSE AND THE TOWN MOUSE.


A Field Mouse had a friend who lived in a house in town. Now the Town
Mouse was asked by the Field Mouse to dine with him, and out he went and
sat down to a meal of corn and wheat.

“Do you know, my friend,” said he, “that you live a mere ant’s life out
here? Why, I have all kinds of things at home; come and enjoy them.”

So the two set off for town, and there the Town Mouse showed his beans
and meal, his dates, too; his cheese and fruit and honey. And as the
Field Mouse ate, drank, and was merry, he thought how rich his friend was
and how poor he was.

But as they ate, a man all at once opened the door, and the mice were in
such fear that they ran into a crack.

Then when they would eat some nice figs, in came a maid to get a pot of
honey or a bit of cheese; and when they saw her, they hid in a hole.

Then the Field Mouse would eat no more, but said to the Town Mouse: “Do
as you like, my good friend; eat all you want, have your fill of good
things, but you are always in fear of your life. As for me, poor Mouse,

A DUTCH WINTER.


[Illustration]

    The windmills of Holland are silent and stilled,
    Their whirling has ceased, for their long arms are chilled.
    The ice-prisoned boats are hung with a lace
    Of Flemish design of most delicate grace.
    While the watchman calls out, with a voice like a bell,
    The time by the tower, and adds, “All is well.”

    The tulips are hid ’neath a rug of soft white,
    They’re dreaming of spring, and the sun warm and bright.
    The rollicking lads, with the lassies in wake,
    Sweep by on their ice skates of old Friesian make,
    While the watchman calls out, with a voice like a bell,
    The time by the tower, and adds, “All is well.”

    In the land of the windmills, the stars one by one
    Slowly people the heavens, for night has begun.
    The rosy-cheeked babies, in nightcap and gown,
    Are asleep in their cradles with curtains hung down,
    While the watchman calls out with a voice like a bell,
    The time by the tower, and adds, “All is well.”

THANKSGIVING DAY.


[Illustration]

    Over the river and through the wood,
        To grandfather’s house we go;
            The horse knows the way
            To carry the sleigh
        Through the white and drifted snow.
    Over the river and through the wood—
        Oh, how the wind does blow!
            It stings the toes
            And bites the nose,
        As over the ground we go.

    Over the river and through the wood,
        To have a first-rate play.
            Hear the bells ring,
            “Ting-a-ling-ding!”
        Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!
    Over the river and through the wood,
        Trot fast, my dapple-gray!
            Spring over the ground,
            Like a hunting hound!
        For this is Thanksgiving Day.

    Over the river and through the wood,
        And straight through the barn-yard gate.
            We seem to go
            Extremely slow—
        It is so hard to wait!
    Over the river and through the wood—
        Now grandmother’s cap I spy!
            Hurrah for the fun!
            Is the pudding done?
        Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!

    He thought he saw a Buffalo,
          Upon the chimney piece.
    He looked again, and found it was

    “Unless you leave this house,” he said,

LUCY’S BALLOON.


Little Donald was one day taken by his father to see the circus
procession. His little sister Lucy was obliged to stay at home. While
they were standing on the sidewalk, the father bought two balloons,
saying, “One of these is for you, Donald, and the other we will take home
to Lucy.” On account of the dense crowd, the father was carrying the
balloons, holding them high above his head, when suddenly one of them
exploded. Donald looked at it in dismay for a moment. Then his little
face brightened, and he said cheerfully, “It’s too bad that _Lucy’s_
balloon is spoiled, but I will let her play with mine sometimes.”

CHOOSING A NAME.


    I have got a new-born sister;
    I was nigh the first that kissed her.
    When the nursing woman brought her
    To papa, his infant daughter,
    How papa’s dear eyes did glisten!—
    She will shortly be to christen:
    And papa has made the offer,
    I shall have the naming of her.

    Now, I wonder what would please her—
    Charlotte, Julia, or Louisa?
    Ann and Mary, they’re too common;
    Joan’s too formal for a woman;
    Jane’s a prettier name beside;
    But we had a Jane that died.
    They would say, if ’twas Rebecca,
    That she was a little Quaker.
    Edith’s pretty, but that looks
    Better in old English books;
    Ellen’s left off long ago;
    Blanche is out of fashion now.

    None that I have named as yet
    Are so good as Margaret.
    Emily is neat and fine.
    What do you think of Caroline?
    How I’m puzzled and perplext
    What to choose or think of next!
    I am in a little fever
    Lest the name that I should give her
    Should disgrace her or defame her.
    I will leave papa to name her.

RULES OF BEHAVIOR.


Every action in company ought to be with some sign of respect to those
present.

Think before you speak, pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring your words
too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

Associate yourself with men of good quality, if you esteem your own
reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.

THE LOST DOLL.


    I once had a sweet little doll, dears,
        The prettiest doll in the world;
    Her cheeks were so red and white, dears,
        And her hair was so charmingly curled.
    But I lost my poor little doll, dears,
        As I played on the heath one day;
    And I cried for her more than a week, dears,
        But I never could find where she lay.

    I found my poor little doll, dears,
        As I played on the heath one day;
    Folks say she is terribly changed, dears,
        For her paint is all washed away,
    And her arms trodden off by the cows, dears,
        And her hair not the least bit curled;
    Yet for old sake’s sake, she is still, dears,
        The prettiest doll in the world.

OLD SANTA CLAUS.


    Old Santa Claus sat alone in his den,
        With his leg crossed over his knee;
    While a comical look peeped out of his eyes,
        For a funny old fellow was he.

    His queer little cap was tumbled and torn,
        And his wig it was all awry;
    But he sat and mused the whole day long,
        While the hours went flying by.

    He had been as busy as busy could be,
        In filling his pack with toys;
    He had gathered his nuts and baked his pies,
        To give to the girls and boys.

    There were dolls for the girls, and whips for the boys,
        With wheelbarrows, horses and drays,
    And bureaus and trunks for Dolly’s new clothes;
        All these in his pack he displays.

    Of candy, too, both twisted and striped,
        He had furnished a plentiful store;
    While raisins and figs, and prunes and grapes,
        Hung up on a peg by the door.

    “I’m almost ready,” quoth he, quoth he,
        “And Christmas is almost here;
    But one thing more—I must write a book,
        And give to each one this year.”

    So he clapped his specks on his little round nose,
        And seizing the stump of a pen,
    He wrote more lines in one little hour
        Than you ever could read in ten.

    He told them stories all pretty and new,
        And wrote them all out in rhyme;
    Then packed them away with his box of toys
        To distribute one at a time.

    And Christmas Eve when all were in bed,
        Right down the chimney he flew;
    And stretching the stocking leg out at the top,
        He clapped in a book for you.

A RIDDLE.

(A book.)


[Illustration]

    I’m a strange contradiction; I’m new, and I’m old,
    I’m often in tatters and oft decked with gold.
    Though I never could read, yet lettered I’m found;
    Though blind, I enlighten; though loose, I am bound;
    I’m always in black, and I’m always in white;
    I’m grave and I’m gay, I am heavy and light—
    In form, too, I differ—I’m thick and I’m thin,

    I’ve no flesh and no bones, yet I’m covered with skin;
    I’ve more points than the compass, more stops than the flute;
    I sing without voice, without speaking confute.
    I’m English, I’m German, I’m French, and I’m Dutch;
    Some love me too fondly, some slight me too much;
    I often die soon, though I sometimes live ages,
    And no monarch alive has so many pages.

A BOY’S SONG.


    Where the pools are bright and deep,
    Where the gray trout lies asleep,
    Up the river and o’er the lea,
    That’s the way for Billy and me.

    Where the blackbird sings the latest,
    Where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest,
    Where the nestlings chirp and flee,
    That’s the way for Billy and me.

    Where the mowers mow the cleanest,
    Where the hay lies thick and greenest,
    There to trace the homeward bee,
    That’s the way for Billy and me.

    Where the hazel bank is steepest,
    Where the shadow falls the deepest,
    Where the clustering nuts fall free,
    That’s the way for Billy and me.

    Why the boys should drive away,
    Little sweet maidens from the play,
    Or love to banter and fight so well,
    That’s the thing I never could tell.

    But this I know, I love to play,
    Through the meadow, among the hay,
    Up the water and o’er the lea,
    That’s the way for Billy and me.

    His body will make me a nice little stew,
    And his giblets will make me a little pie, too.”
    Says the little cock-sparrow, “I’ll be shot if I stay,”

MY SHIP AND I.


[Illustration]

    O it’s I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,
    Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;
        And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;
        But when I’m a little older, I shall find the secret out
    How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.

    For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,
    And the dolly I intend to come alive;
        And with him beside to help me, it’s a-sailing I shall go,
        It’s a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow
    And the vessel goes a divie-divie-dive.

    O it’s then you’ll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,
    And you’ll hear the water singing at the prow;
        For beside the dolly sailor, I’m to voyage and explore,
        To land upon the island where no dolly was before,
    And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.

    No Pussy Willows can be found;
    But, dreaming in their beds, they hear
    The first awakening of the year.

    Then soon through frosty windows peep
    The downy Pussies, roused from sleep.
    “The spring is here!” they softly purr—
    And out they pop to welcome her.

_The Babes in the Wood._


    My dear, do you know,
      How a long time ago,
    Two poor little children,
      Whose names I don’t know,
    Were stolen away,
      On a fine summer’s day,
    And left in the wood,
      As I’ve heard people say.

    And when it was night,
      So sad was their plight,
    The sun it went down,
      And the moon gave no light!
    They sobbed, and they sighed
      And they bitterly cried,
    And the poor little things,
      They lay down and died.

    And when they were dead,
      The Robins so red
    Brought strawberry leaves,
      And over them spread;
    And all the day long,
      They sung them this song:
    “Poor babes in the wood! poor babes in the wood!
    And don’t you remember the babes in the wood?”




A DUTCH LULLABY.


[Illustration]

    Far over the water so blue and so deep,
    The little Dutch babies are going to sleep;
    Bright yellow tulips are nodding their heads
    And fluffy young ducks are safe in their beds,
    While slowly the windmills go whirling around—
    Go whirling around—go whirling around.

    Far over the water the sails are furled
    And the stars peep out on a sleepy world;
    The moo cows moo softly beneath the trees
    And the white sheep drowse in the evening breeze,
    While slowly the windmills go whirling around—
    Go whirling around—go whirling around.

    Far over the water comes down the night,
    Fading and fading the silvery light,
    While storks on their nests stand white and tall,
    And over the tree-tops the shadows fall.
    While slowly the windmills go whirling around—
    Go whirling around—go whirling around.

IF WE WORK UPON MARBLE.


If we work upon marble, it will perish; if we work upon brass, time will
efface it; if we rear temples, they will crumble into dust! but if we
work upon our immortal minds, if we imbue them with principles—with the
just fear of God and our fellowmen—we engrave on those tablets something
which will brighten to all eternity.

THE DUEL.


[Illustration]

    The gingham dog and the calico cat
    Side by side on the table sat;
    ’Twas half-past twelve, and (what do you think!)
    Not one nor t’other had slept a wink!
    The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate
    Appeared to know as sure as fate
    There was going to be a terrible spat
    (_I wasn’t there; I simply state_
    _What was told to me by the Chinese plate!_)

    The gingham dog went “bow-wow-wow!”
    And the calico cat replied “mee-ow!”
    The air was littered an hour or so,
    With bits of gingham and calico;
    While the old Dutch clock in the chimney-place,
    Up with its hands before its face,
    For it always dreaded a family row!
    (_Now mind: I’m only telling you_
    _What the old Dutch clock declares is true!_)

    The Chinese plate looked very blue,
    And wailed, “Oh, dear! what shall we do!”
    But the gingham dog and the calico cat
    Wallowed this way and tumbled that,
    Employing every tooth and claw
    In the awfullest way you ever saw—
    And, Oh! how the gingham and calico flew!
    (_Don’t fancy I exaggerate!_
    _I got my views from the Chinese plate!_)

    Next morning where the two had sat
    They found no trace of dog or cat;
    And some folks think unto this day
    That burglars stole that pair away!
    But the truth about that cat and pup
    Is this: They ate each other up!
    Now what do you really think of that!
    (_The old Dutch clock it told me so,_
    _And that is how I came to know._)

THE ANT AND THE CRICKET.


[Illustration]

    A silly young cricket, accustomed to sing
    Through the warm sunny months of gay summer and spring,
    Began to complain, when he found that at home
    His cupboard was empty and winter was come.
            Not a crumb to be found
            On the snow-covered ground;
            Not a flower could he see,
            Not a leaf on a tree:
    “Oh, what will come,” says the cricket, “of me?”

    At last by starvation and famine made bold,
    All dripping with wet and all trembling with cold,
    Away he set off to a miserly ant,
    To see if, to keep him alive he would grant
            Him a shelter from rain:
            A mouthful of grain
            He wished only to borrow,
            He’d repay it to-morrow:
    If not, he must die of starvation and sorrow.

    Says the ant to the cricket, “I’m your servant and friend,
    But we ants never borrow, we ants never lend;
    But tell me, dear sir, did you lay nothing by
    When the weather was warm?” Said the cricket, “Not I.
            My heart was so light
            That I sang day and night,
            For all nature looked gay.”
            “You _sang_, sir, you say?
    Go then,” said the ant, “and _dance_ winter away.”

    Thus ending, he hastily lifted the wicket
    And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
    Though this is a fable, the moral is good;
    If you live without work, you must live without food.

    Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
      And dreamed she heard them bleating;
    But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
      For they were still a-fleeting.

    Then up she took her little crook,
      Determined for to find them;
    She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
      For they’d left all their tails behind ’em.

    Who’ll come and play with me here under the tree,
        My sisters have left me alone;
    My sweet little sparrow, come hither to me,
        And play with me while they are gone.

    O no, little lady, I can’t come, indeed,
        I’ve no time to idle away,
    I’ve got all my dear little children to feed,
        And my nest to new cover with hay.

    Pretty Bee, do not buzz about over the flower,
        But come here and play with me, do:
    The sparrow won’t come and stay with me an hour,
        But stay, pretty Bee—will not you?

    O no, little lady, for do not you see
        Those must work who would prosper and thrive,
    If I play, they would call me a sad idle bee—
        And perhaps turn me out of the hive.

    Stop! stop! little Ant—do not run off so fast,
        Wait with me a little and play:
    I hope I shall find a companion at last,
        You are not so busy as they.

    O no, little lady, I can’t stay with you,
        We’re not made to play, but to labor:
    I always have something or other to do,
        If not for myself, for my neighbor.

    Why then, have they all employment but me,
        Who lie lounging here like a dunce?
    O then, like the Ant, and the Sparrow, and Bee,
        I’ll go to my lesson at once.

A CHILD’S THOUGHT OF GOD.


[Illustration]

    They say that God lives very high!
        But if you look above the pines
    You cannot see our God. And why?

    And if you dig down in the mines
        You never see him in the gold,
    Though from him all that’s glory shines.

    God is so good, He wears a fold
        Of heaven and earth across His face—
    Like secrets kept, for love, untold.

    But still I feel that His embrace
        Slides down by thrills, through all things made.
    Through sight and sound of every place:

    As if my tender mother laid
        On my shut lids, her kisses’ pressure,
    Half-waking me at night, and said:
        “Who kissed you through the dark, dear guesser?”

THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.


An ancient Italian legend tells how Good St. Nicholas of Padua first gave
presents on Christmas Eve by throwing purses in at the open windows of
needy people. Purses in those days were knitted of yarn and tied with
strings at the open ends. They were not unlike stockings, except that
they had no feet. People began to hang these long empty purses of yarn on
their window-sills on Christmas Eve, so that St. Nicholas, as he passed
by, could put money into them. When money became scarce the long purses
were filled with presents instead—useful things for the big people, and
books and toys for the children.

In cold countries, where the windows could not be left open, folks hung
their purses near the fireplace, believing that St. Nicholas would come
down the chimney and leave his presents for them. And after the knitted
purses went out of fashion they hung up their stockings, which closely
resembled the old-time purses, so that there would be plenty of room for
the Christmas presents, and old St. Nicholas (Santa Claus), who lived on
through all the ages, would know he had been expected.

That is how the Christmas stocking came to be used, and why it will
be used for many generations to come in thousands of homes on each
succeeding Christmas Eve....

THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT.

    The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
        In a beautiful pea-green boat;
    They took some honey, and plenty of money
        Wrapped in a five pound note.
    The Owl looked up to the moon above,
        And sang to a small guitar,
    “O lovely pussy! O Pussy, my love,
        What a beautiful Pussy you are,—
            You are,
        What a beautiful Pussy you are!”

    Pussy said to the Owl, “You elegant fowl!
        How wonderful sweet you sing!
    O let us be married,—too long we have tarried,—
        But what shall we do for a ring?”
    They sailed away for a year and a day
        To the land where the Bong tree grows
    And there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood
        With a ring at the end of his nose,—
            His nose,
        With a ring at the end of his nose.

    “Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for a shilling
        Your ring?” Said the piggy, “I will.”
    So they took it away and were married next day
        By the turkey who lives on the hill.
    They dined upon mince and slices of quince,
        Which they ate with a runcible spoon,
    And hand in hand on the edge of the sand
        They danced by the light of the moon,—
            The moon,
        They danced by the light of the moon.

    How pleasant it is at the end of the day,
        No follies to have to repent;
    But reflect on the past and be able to say,
        That my time has been properly spent.

    When I’ve done all my work with patience and care,
        And been good and obliging and kind,
    I lay on my pillow and sleep away care,
        With a happy and peaceable mind.

    But instead of all this, if it must be confessed,
        That I careless and idle have been,
    I lay down as usual and go to my rest,
        But full discontented within.

    Then, as I don’t like all the trouble I’ve had,
        In future I’ll try to prevent it,
    For I never am naughty without being sad,
        Or good—without being contented.

BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.


    Buttercups and daisies,
        Oh, the pretty flowers—
    Coming ere the spring time,
        To tell of sunny hours.
    While the trees are leafless,
        While the fields are bare,
    Buttercups and daisies
        Spring up here and there.

    Ere the snowdrop peepeth,
        Ere the crocus bold,
    Ere the early primrose
        Opes its paly gold,
    Somewhere on the sunny bank
        Buttercups are bright;
    Somewhere ’mong the frozen grass
        Peeps the daisy white.

    Little hardy flowers,
        Like to children poor,
    Playing in their sturdy health
        By their mother’s door,
    Purple with the north wind,
        Yet alert and bold;
    Fearing not, and caring not,
        Though they be a-cold!

    What to them is Winter!
        What are stormy showers!
    Buttercups and daisies
        Are these human flowers!
    He who gave them hardships
        And a life of care,
    Gave them likewise hardy strength
        And patient hearts to bear.

                                                           —_Mary Howitt._

_A Farmer Went Trotting._


    A farmer went trotting
    Upon his grey mare,
      Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    With his daughter behind him,
    So rosy and fair,
      Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

    A raven cried “Croak!”
    And they all tumbled down,
      Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    The mare broke her knees,
    And the farmer his crown,
      Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

    The mischievous raven
    Flew laughing away,
      Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    And vowed he would serve them
    The same next day,
      Lumpety, lumpety, lump!




_Black We Are._


    Black we are, but much admired;
    Men seek for us till they are tired;
    We tire the horse, but comfort man;
    Tell me this riddle if you can.

THE LITTLE ELF.


    I met a little Elf-man, once,
        Down where the lilies blow.
    I asked him why he was so small
        And why he didn’t grow.

    He slightly frowned, and with his eye
        He looked me through and through.
    “I’m quite as big for me,” said he,
        “As you are big for you.”

HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE.


    How doth the little busy bee
        Improve each shining hour,
    And gather honey all the day
        From every opening flow’r!

    How skilfully she builds her cell!
        How neat she spreads the wax!
    And labors hard to store it well
        With the sweet food she makes.

    In works of labor or of skill,
        I would be busy, too;
    For Satan finds some mischief still
        For idle hands to do.

    In books, or work, or healthful play,
        Let my first years be past,
    That I may give for ev’ry day
        Some good account at last.

A FAREWELL.


[Illustration]

    My fairest child, I have no song to give you;
        No lark could pipe to skies so dull and gray;
    Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you
        For every day.

    Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever;
        Do noble things, not dream them all day long
    And so make life, death, and that vast forever,
        One grand, sweet song.

                                                      —_Charles Kingsley._




THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIRDS.


    Do you ask what the birds say? The Sparrow, the Dove,
    The Linnet and Thrush say, “I love and I love!”
    In the winter they’re silent—the wind is so strong;
    What it says, I don’t know, but it sings a loud song.
    But green leaves, and blossoms, and sunny warm weather,
    And singing and loving all come back together.

    “I love, and I love,” almost all the birds say,
    From sunrise to star-rise, so gladsome are they!
    But the Lark is so brimful of gladness and love,
    The green fields below him, the blue sky above,
    That he sings, and he sings; and forever sings he—
    “I love my Love, and my Love loves me!”

                                               —_Samuel Taylor Coleridge._

REMEDY FOR EVIL.


    For every evil under the sun,
    There is a remedy, or there is none.
    If there be one, try and find it.
    If there be none, never mind it.

MEDDLESOME MATTY.


    One ugly trick has often spoiled
        The sweetest and the best;
    Matilda, though a pleasant child,
        One ugly trick possessed,
    Which, like a cloud before the skies
    Hid all her better qualities.

    Sometimes she’d lift the tea-pot lid,
        To peep at what was in it;
    Or tilt the kettle, if you did
        But turn your back a minute.
    In vain you told her not to touch,
    Her trick of meddling grew so much.

    Her grandmamma went out one day,
        And by mistake she laid
    Her spectacles, and snuff-box gay
        Too near the little maid;
    “Ah! well,” thought she, “I’ll try them on,
    As soon as grandmamma is gone.”

    Forthwith she placed upon her nose
        The glasses large and wide;
    And looking round, as I suppose,
        The snuff-box, too, she spied:
    “Oh! what a pretty box is that;
    I’ll open it,” said little Matt.

    “I know that grandmamma would say,
        ‘Don’t meddle with it, dear;’
    But, then, she’s far enough away,
        And no one else is near:
    Besides, what can there be amiss
    In opening such a box as this?”

    So thumb and finger went to work
        To move the stubborn lid,
    And presently a mighty jerk
        The mighty mischief did;
    For all at once, ah! woeful case,
    The snuff came puffing in her face.

    Poor eyes and nose, and mouth beside,
        A dismal sight presented;
    In vain, as bitterly she cried,
        Her folly she repented.
    In vain she ran about for ease;
    She could do nothing now but sneeze.

    She dashed the spectacles away,
        To wipe her tingling eyes,
    And as in twenty bits they lay,
        Her grandmamma she spies.
    “Hey-day! and what’s the matter now?”
    Says grandmamma, with lifted brow.

    Matilda, smarting with the pain,
        And tingling still, and sore,
    Made many a promise to refrain,
        From meddling any more.
    And ’tis a fact, as I have heard,
    She ever since has kept her word.

                                                            —_Ann Taylor._

TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR.


[Illustration]

    Twinkle, twinkle, little star!
    How I wonder what you are,
    Up above the world so high,
    Like a diamond in the sky.

    When the glorious sun is set,
    When the grass with dew is wet,
    Then you show your little light,
    Twinkle, twinkle all the night.

    In the dark-blue sky you keep,
    And often through thy curtains peep,
    For you never shut your eye,
    Till the sun is in the sky.

    As your bright and tiny spark
    Guides the traveler in the dark,
    Though I know not what you are,
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star!

                                                           —_Jane Taylor._




THE NIGHTINGALE AND GLOWWORM.


    A nightingale that all day long
    Had cheer’d the village with his song,
    Nor yet at eve his note suspended,
    Nor yet when eventide was ended,
    Began to feel, as well he might,
    The keen demands of appetite;
    When looking eagerly around,
    He spied far off, upon the ground,
    A something shining in the dark,
    And knew the glowworm by his spark;
    So stooping down from hawthorn top,
    He thought to put him in his crop.
    The worm, aware of his intent,
    Harangued him thus, right eloquent:
        “Did _you_ admire my lamp,” quoth he,
        “As much as I your minstrelsy,
        You would _abhor_ to do me wrong,
        As much as I to spoil your song;
        For ’twas the self same power Divine
        Taught _you_ to sing and _me_ to shine;
        That you with music, I with light,
        Might beautify and cheer the night.”
    The songster heard his short oration,
    And, warbling out his approbation,
    Released him, as my story tells,
    And found a supper somewhere else.

                                                        —_William Cowper._

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
